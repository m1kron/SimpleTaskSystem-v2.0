//////////////////////////////////////////////

This library contains implementation of basic threading stuff - including thread implementation
and fiber as well as  implemenation of synchronization primitives ( mutex, spinlock, event etc ),
finishing on atomic implmentation. Most of the interfaces are stl-like, but there are differences.
Some of the stuff here is done for educational purposes only.

This lib supports only win platform, but it is possible to add more.
